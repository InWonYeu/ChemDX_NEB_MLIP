# ChemDX_NEB_MLIP

Machine Learning Interatomic Potential (MLIP) project using the ChemDX database  
üèÜ Developed as part of the **KRICT ChemDX Hackathon 2025**

---

## üß† Motivation

> **Can we systematically supply missing data that greatly improves MLIPs?**

Many MLIPs suffer from poor transferability due to insufficient or biased training data, which is often limited to equilibrium configurations. In this project, we explore whether supplementing *minimum energy path (MEP)* data (from NEB calculations) can improve the **accuracy and stability** of MLIP models.

## üî¨ System Overview

### Workflow

1. **Data Generation**
    - Sampled atomic structures using Relaxation, MD, and NEB (via ASE)
    - Focus: Adsorption systems (Au/OH on Al(100), Au on AlPd(100))

2. **ANN Model Training**
    - Trained two separate neural network potentials:
        - **Set #1**: Relax + MD
        - **Set #2**: Relax + MD + NEB

3. **Model Evaluation**
    - Tested models through ANN-MD simulations
    - Compared energy conservation and force accuracy

### ‚öõÔ∏è MD Stability: NEB Makes a Difference

| Model Type         | Force Error | Energy Conservation |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| MD-only            | High        | ‚ùå                    |
| MD + **NEB**       | Low         | ‚úÖ                    |

## üõ† Tools Used

- **ASE**: Structure generation, Relaxation, MD, NEB
- **AMP** (ASE's ML package): ANN model training
- **ChemDX Database**: Initial structure and metadata source
- Python (Jupyter), Matplotlib, NumPy

---

## üîç Conclusion

Adding NEB-based data significantly improves:
- Sampling of off-equilibrium regions
- Force prediction accuracy
- Energy conservation during MD

This strategy enables **more reliable and transferable MLIPs**, especially for surface and catalytic systems.
